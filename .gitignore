# Temporary media folder
/tt/

# --- Auramixer Specific --- #
# The following lines ignore the *contents* of the media folders, 
# but not the folders themselves. This is useful to avoid committing large
# media files to Git. You can add an empty file named ".gitkeep" inside
# each of these folders to ensure the empty directories are tracked.

# Uncomment the lines below if you want to ignore media files:
 /backgrounds/*
/backgrounds/.gitkeep
/effects/*
/effects/.gitkeep
/music/*
/music/.gitkeep
documents/
